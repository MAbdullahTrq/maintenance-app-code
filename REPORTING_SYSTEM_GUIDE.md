## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Dynamic Filtering Logic

```php
// Owner selection filters properties
GET /api/properties-by-owner?owner_id=123

// Property selection filters technicians  
GET /api/technicians-by-properties?property_ids[]=1&property_ids[]=2
```

### Permission System
- **Property Managers**: See only their own properties/technicians
- **Admins**: See all data across the system
- **Technicians**: No access to reporting (can be extended)

### Report Types Detection
System automatically determines report type based on selected filters:

```php
private function determineReportType(Request $request): string
{
    if ($request->filled('owner_id') && !$request->filled('property_ids') && !$request->filled('technician_ids')) {
        return 'All work across owner\'s properties';
    }
    // ... more logic
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Data Showing**:
   - Check date range selection
   - Verify user has access to properties
   - Ensure maintenance requests exist in date range

2. **AJAX Filtering Not Working**:
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify CSRF token is present
   - Check network requests in DevTools

3. **Export Not Working**:
   - Check server error logs
   - Verify file permissions
   - Check browser download settings

### Debug Mode
Controller includes comprehensive logging:
```php
Log::info('Report generated', [
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'filters' => $request->all(),
    'result_count' => $requests->count()
]);
```
