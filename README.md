# Maintenance Request Management Application

A Laravel-based application to handle maintenance requests submitted by guest users to property managers. Property managers can then allocate those requests to technicians for resolution.

## Features

- **User Roles**:
  - **Super Property Manager**: Oversees the entire platform and manages client accounts.
  - **Property Manager**: Handles work orders, approves requests, and assigns tasks. This user is behind a subscription paywall.
  - **Technician**: Invited by the Property Manager to complete maintenance tasks.
  - **Guest User**: Non-logged-in users who submit maintenance requests via QR code or link.

- **Maintenance Request Workflow**:
  1. **Submit a Maintenance Request** â€“ No Login Required
     - Requesters scan a QR code or click a link to access the request page.
     - They provide location, title, description, images, and optional contact information.
     - The request is instantly sent to the Property Manager dashboard.
  
  2. **Request Review & Approval**
     - The Property Manager reviews and approves the request.
     - Assigns a due date and selects the right technician for the job.
     - The request is converted into a Work Order.
  
  3. **Task Assignment & Technician Notification**
     - The assigned technician receives a notification.
     - They can accept or decline the task.
  
  4. **Work in Progress**
     - The technician logs in and opens the Work Order.
     - They can upload photos, add notes, and provide real-time updates via comments.
  
  5. **Completion & Confirmation**
     - When the job is done, the technician marks it as complete and submits a final report.
     - The Property Manager verifies completion before officially closing the task.
     - Email notifications are sent to both the Property Manager and Requester.

- **Subscription System**:
  - Property Managers need to subscribe to use the platform.
  - Multiple subscription plans with different property and technician limits.
  - PayPal integration for payment processing.
