# Twilio SMS Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Twilio SMS functionality for the MaintainXtra application.

## Prerequisites

1. A Twilio account (sign up at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com))
2. A Twilio phone number for sending SMS messages
3. Your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token

## Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+1234567890
TWILIO_SMS_ENABLED=true
TWILIO_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com/twilio/webhook
```

### 2. Get Your Twilio Credentials

1. Log in to your Twilio Console
2. Go to the Dashboard
3. Copy your Account SID and Auth Token
4. Go to Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Active numbers
5. Purchase or use an existing phone number for sending SMS

### 3. Phone Number Format

The system expects phone numbers in international format:
- ‚úÖ `+1234567890` (US number)
- ‚úÖ `+447911123456` (UK number)
- ‚ùå `1234567890` (missing country code)
- ‚ùå `(123) 456-7890` (formatted number)

## Testing

### Test SMS Command

Use the artisan command to test SMS functionality:

```bash
php artisan sms:test +1234567890
```

Replace `+1234567890` with your actual phone number.

### Test Technician Assignment

1. Create a maintenance request
2. Assign it to a technician with a valid phone number
3. The technician should receive both email and SMS notifications

## SMS Message Format

When a technician is assigned to a maintenance request, they will receive an SMS with the following format:

```
üîß New Maintenance Request Assigned

Property: [Property Name]
Title: [Request Title]
Priority: [Priority Level]
Due Date: [Due Date]

Please review and take appropriate action.

MaintainXtra
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid phone number format"**
   - Ensure phone numbers are in international format with country code
   - Example: `+1234567890` for US numbers

2. **"SMS sending is disabled"**
   - Set `TWILIO_SMS_ENABLED=true` in your `.env` file

3. **"Failed to send SMS"**
   - Check your Twilio credentials
   - Verify your Twilio account has sufficient credits
   - Check the Laravel logs for detailed error messages

### Logs

SMS-related logs are written to the Laravel log file:
- Success: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Errors: Check for "Failed to send SMS" messages

### Disabling SMS

To disable SMS functionality temporarily:
```env
TWILIO_SMS_ENABLED=false
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit your Twilio credentials to version control
2. **Phone Number Validation**: The system validates phone numbers before sending
3. **Error Handling**: Failed SMS attempts are logged but don't break the application
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for SMS sending

## Cost Considerations

- Twilio charges per SMS sent
- International SMS rates vary by country
- Consider implementing SMS limits or user preferences
- Monitor your Twilio usage in the Twilio Console
