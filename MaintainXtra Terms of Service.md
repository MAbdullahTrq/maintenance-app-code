MaintainXtra Terms of Service
Last updated: 10 August 2025
These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern access to and use of the MaintainXtra website at www.maintainxtra.com and related applications, platforms, and services (collectively, the “Service”). These Terms form a binding agreement between MaintainXtra (“we,” “us,” or “our”) and the entity or person agreeing to these Terms (“Customer,” “you,” or “your”). If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
Summary (not legally binding): MaintainXtra is a monthly subscription SaaS built for property managers and vacation rental managers. Your plan auto-renews each month until cancelled. You own your data; we license the software. Please use the Service lawfully and responsibly.

3. Free Trial, Grace Period, Cancellations & Refunds
3.1 30-Day Free Trial (no credit card). When you sign up with your name, email, and password, your trial begins immediately (trial_started_at = the time of registration) and ends 30 days later (trial_expires_at = trial_started_at + 30 days). During Day 0–30, you have full access to the features included in your Plan.
3.2 Post-Trial Grace Period (Days 31–37). From the day after your trial expires through Day 37, your account enters a 7-day grace period. On login you will be redirected to the payment screen with the notice: “Your free trial has ended. Subscribe now to keep your data.”
3.3 Account Lock (from Day 38). If payment is not completed by Day 38 after trial expiration, your account is locked. Locked accounts cannot access the Service and will see: “Your trial has expired. Reactivate anytime to continue.”
3.4 Cancellation (Paid Plans). You can cancel any paid subscription at any time via billing settings. Cancellation becomes effective at the end of the current billing period; you will retain access until then.
3.5 Refunds. Except where required by law or expressly stated otherwise, all fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, including for partial periods and unused features.
3.6 Trials Are As-Is. During the free trial, the Service is provided “as is” with no warranties or commitments, and features or limits may change.
Timing note: Day counts are measured from the trial_expires_at timestamp maintained in our systems and may be calculated in UTC.
